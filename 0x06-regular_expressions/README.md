# REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

In this module we learnt about regex and how they can allow us go through various amounts of text to look for patterns or allow us simply retrieve certain pieces of data from input

The files include
1. 0-simply\_match\_school.rb
2. 1-repetition\_token\_0.rb
3. 2-repetition\_token\_1.rb
4. 3-repetition\_token\_2.rb
5. 4-repetition\_token\_3.rb
6. 5-beginning\_and\_end.rb
7. 6-phone\_number.rb
8. 7-OMG\_WHY\_ARE\_YOU\_SHOUTING.rb
